# 🎵 Music Genre Classification with Machine Learning

**Status:** On Going 
**University Project** – Óbuda University, BSc in Computer Engineering  
**Subject:** Machine Learning / AI specialization

## 📘 Overview

This project focuses on the automatic classification of music tracks into predefined **genres** using machine learning techniques.

By analyzing audio features (e.g., MFCC, chroma, tempo), the model predicts the genre of a given song segment. The goal is to demonstrate practical AI usage in multimedia data processing and genre recognition.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **Python** (main language)
- **Librosa** for audio feature extraction
- **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Scikit-learn** for data processing and ML
- **TensorFlow** and/or **Keras** for deep learning models
- **Streamlit** for interactive web-based demo (if implemented)

## 🎓 Educational Context

This project was developed as part of the **AI specialization** in the **Computer Engineering BSc program** at **Óbuda University**.

It showcases a full ML workflow from feature engineering to model evaluation and deployment.
