# 🎵 Music Genre Classification with Machine Learning

## Status: On Going

## 👋🏼 Welcome to my project work!

This repository is part of a semester-long assignment for the **Ai Projectwork** course at the **University of Óbuda**, within the **Artificial Intelligence specialization**.

I collected music from Spotify with genres, which I first split into 15 categories, but later in the project I clustered them into 8 genres. <br> The aim of the project is to create an Ai model that predicts the 3 most likely genres by segmenting the music.

## 📂 Dataset

This project uses the publicly available **Spotify API** and an album.
[The Sound of Everything](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/69fEt9DN5r4JQATi52sRtq?si=33218d81df2d430d)

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Python** – primary programming language  
- **Streamlit** - deploy
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** – visualization of metrics  
- **Scikit-learn** – classification evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.)
- **NLTK** (WordNet) – synonym detection and semantic filtering
- **Sentence Transformers** – embedding-based similarity for synonym elimination
